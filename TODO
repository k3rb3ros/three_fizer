* write IV to the begining of encrypted files
* finish cbc mode encrypt and decrypt functions
* Break file reads/writes into block operations to speed up Disk/IO 
* break up encryption into super blocks to encrypt files that are larger then ram size
* Add asynchronous writing to encryption
* parallelize decryption for speed increase
